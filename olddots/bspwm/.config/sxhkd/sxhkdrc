#
# SXHKD module with WM-agnostic keys
#
# Part of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#

# Description
# ===========
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to
# work with `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed
# with GNU Stow.  See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# Note that `mod3' is the Hyper key, which I enable via Xmodmap (see my
# bspwmrc and relevant configs).


# Environment
# -----------

# I am using the prefix `mod3 + e' as a mnemonic for "environment".
#
# The following commands are:
#
# f == bspwm focus mode (my script)
# s == reload sxhkd
# p == reload melonpanel (my lemonbar script)
# t == dmenu to choose Tempus theme
# x == reload the Xresources file
mod3 + e ; {f,s,p,t,x}
    { \
    bspwm_focus_mode, \
    pkill -USR1 -x sxhkd && notify-send -i key_bindings "Reloaded key bindings", \
    pkill -x melonpanel && melonpanel, \
    tempusmenu, \
    xrdb -I "$HOME" -merge "$HOME"/.Xresources \
    }

# Invoke the session management menu (log out, lock, reboot, shutdown).
ctrl + alt + Delete
     poweroptionsmenu

# Keyboard layout
# ---------------
# We can set the keyboard layouts, as well as the toggle directly via
# `setxkbmap`.  Example of what I used to run:
#
#	setxkbmap -layout 'us,gr' -option 'grp:alt_caps_toggle'
#
# However, doing so means losing out on the possibility to easily find
# out the current/active layout from a script: X knows about "us,gr" in
# that order, not which one is currently typing.  As such, in `bspwmrc`
# I simply autostart `setxkbmap -layout 'us'` without defining the
# second layout and a toggle.  The toggle is set below.  With the
# difference being that it invokes a custom script that switches between
# the us,gr layout.  All this is done to be able to get the active
# keyboard layout and print its name to my system panel (custom lemonbar
# called "melonpanel").
#
# The key chord is based on the Emacs function `toggle-input-method',
# which is bound to C-\
mod3 + backslash
	toggle_kbd_layout

# Main programs
# -------------

# Use Xterm as a standalone tool or with Tmux (with Shift).
mod3 + {_, shift + } Return
	{xterm,xterm -e tmux new-session -A -s 'Default'}

# Show the desired rofi views.
mod3 + {x,b}
     rofi -show {drun,window}

# Bring up a rofi interface for `pass' (the superb UNIX password
# manager).
mod3 + p
     passmenu

# Miscellaneous tools and media keys
# ----------------------------------

# Screenshots (requires `scrot`).  First one is for the focused window.
# The other is of the entire X session (including all active monitors).
# Note that `scrot` also has an interactive mode that I do not use.
